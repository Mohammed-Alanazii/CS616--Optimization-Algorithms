## üìñ About This Course

> [cite_start]This course provides an in-depth exploration of optimization algorithms and their role in artificial intelligence[cite: 8]. [cite_start]It covers both single-solution-based and population-based metaheuristic techniques, including local search, tabu search, genetic algorithms, and swarm intelligence[cite: 9]. [cite_start]Students will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and implement these techniques to solve complex optimization problems in various AI-driven applications[cite: 10]. [cite_start]By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the necessary skills to select appropriate optimization methods, develop AI-based applications, and enhance computational efficiency in real-world scenarios[cite: 12].

### Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a collection of solutions for examples and assignments for the **CS-616** course. The goal is to provide a practical reference for implementing and understanding the optimization algorithms discussed in lectures.
